Installation:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j


Usage:

To run my example, type

./raytracer ../example.txt

Or to run any other example, simply change the input file.

Note:  I placed some textures in the textures directory.  This is not required. However, if you place textures there, make sure in the config files to put textures/ in front of the filename.
