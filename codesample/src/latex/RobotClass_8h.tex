}


Class declaration for the Robot (child class of \hyperlink{classAgent}{Agent}). A robot inherits much of its methods from its parent. However, it also extends it by adding robot-\/specific methods such as point\-To, which points the robot at a target. Future functionality will have the robot controlled by the user physically pressing keys, which will be distinct from how other agents are manipulated.
