Class definition for the \hyperlink{classObstacle}{Obstacle\-Class} (child class of Environment). An obstacle inherits all of its methods from its parent. Improving the code, obstacles have their own unique methods and data. Environment Class \hyperlink{classEnvironment}{Environment\-Class} with static data structure that hold obstacle objects.\-Iteration through the object and moving them based on elasped\-Time.
