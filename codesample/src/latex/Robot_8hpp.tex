}


Class definition for the \hyperlink{classRobot}{Robot} (child class of \hyperlink{classEnvironment}{Environment}). A robot inherits much of its methods from its parent. However, it also extends it by adding robot-\/specific methods such as point\-To, which points the robot at a target. Improving the iteration 2 code, \hyperlink{classRobot}{Robot} adding to sensor about touch and homing. Being able to collide obstacle, \hyperlink{classRobot}{Robot} adding to recognize the target and obstacle.
