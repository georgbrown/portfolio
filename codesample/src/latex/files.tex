\section{File List}
Here is a list of all documented files with brief descriptions\-:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{BaseGfxApp_8hpp}{Base\-Gfx\-App.\-hpp} \\*The basic application class for C\-Sci-\/3081 project. Uses G\-L\-U\-T and G\-L\-U\-I and wraps them in a nice C++ interface }{\pageref{BaseGfxApp_8hpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{BaseObject_8hpp}{Base\-Object.\-hpp} \\*The base class which all other physical objects derive from. It contains core data relevant to all objects, such as speed, size, color, object id number, and collision logic }{\pageref{BaseObject_8hpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{Environment_8hpp}{Environment.\-hpp} \\*The declaration for the enviromnet class. This class explain to update and touch sensor and homing sensor. This class serves as a parent for Physical object Class, The physical object class include collisionstatus, object color, radius, and orientaion }{\pageref{Environment_8hpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bfseries Environment\-Tests.\-hpp} }{\pageref{EnvironmentTests_8hpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{main_8cpp}{main.\-cpp} \\*Main function }{\pageref{main_8cpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{Obstacle_8cpp}{Obstacle.\-cpp} \\*Class definition for the \hyperlink{classObstacle}{Obstacle} (child class of \hyperlink{classEnvironment}{Environment}). An obstacle inherits all of its methods from its parent. Improving the code, obstacles have their own unique methods and data. \hyperlink{classEnvironment}{Environment} Class \hyperlink{classEnvironment}{Environment} with static data structure that hold obstacle objects.\-Iteration through the object and moving them based on elasped\-Time }{\pageref{Obstacle_8cpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bfseries Obstacle.\-hpp} }{\pageref{Obstacle_8hpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{Robot_8cpp}{Robot.\-cpp} \\*A robot inherits much of its methods from its parent. However, it also extends it by adding robot-\/specific methods such as point\-To, which points the robot at a target. Future functionality will have the robot controlled by the user physically pressing keys, which will be distinct from how other agents are manipulated }{\pageref{Robot_8cpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{Robot_8hpp}{Robot.\-hpp} \\*Class definition for the \hyperlink{classRobot}{Robot} (child class of \hyperlink{classEnvironment}{Environment}). A robot inherits much of its methods from its parent. However, it also extends it by adding robot-\/specific methods such as point\-To, which points the robot at a target. Improving the iteration 2 code, \hyperlink{classRobot}{Robot} adding to sensor about touch and homing. Being able to collide obstacle, \hyperlink{classRobot}{Robot} adding to recognize the target and obstacle }{\pageref{Robot_8hpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bfseries Robot\-Tests.\-hpp} }{\pageref{RobotTests_8hpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{Simulation_8cpp}{Simulation.\-cpp} \\*Main application class for the robot simulation }{\pageref{Simulation_8cpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{Simulation_8hpp}{Simulation.\-hpp} \\*Main application class for the robot simulation }{\pageref{Simulation_8hpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{Target_8cpp}{Target.\-cpp} \\*Objects of this type will be targets that the robot points to. A target inherits all of its methods from its parent. However, in the future targets may have their own unique methods and data }{\pageref{Target_8cpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{Target_8hpp}{Target.\-hpp} \\*Class definition for the \hyperlink{classTarget}{Target} (child class of \hyperlink{classEnvironment}{Environment}). An Objects of this type will be targets that the robot points to. A target inherits all of its methods from its parent. Improving the code, targets may have their own unique methods and data. \hyperlink{classEnvironment}{Environment} Class \hyperlink{classEnvironment}{Environment} with static data structure that hold target objects.\-Checking Enviroment\-Class update function }{\pageref{Target_8hpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{Walls_8cpp}{Walls.\-cpp} \\*Class definition for the \hyperlink{classWalls}{Walls} which form the perimeter of the screen }{\pageref{Walls_8cpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{Walls_8hpp}{Walls.\-hpp} \\*Class declaration for the walls which wrap around the perimeter of the window }{\pageref{Walls_8hpp}}{}
